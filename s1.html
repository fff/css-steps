					<p>			When this story is complete, a user can click on the "Expand by POI Type" button for Visits from the table on the Summary or Driver Scorecard pages to view the number of visits for each POI type.After the "Expand by POI Type" button is clicked, the user will see all of the visit metrics organized by POI type, for the level that is in context. So, if I click the "Expand by POI Type" button next to the Visits label, while the "Hyde Park Region" level is in context, then I expect to see all of the Hyde Park region's visits displayed, organized by POI type. Similarly, if I'm on the Driver Scorecard page for Tech 1, and I clicked the "Expand by POI Type" button next to the Visits label, then I expect to see all of Tech 1's visits displayed, organized by POI type.The user should then be able to click the "Expand by POI Type" button to hide all of the POI type metrics.We will eventually have a similar button for the other metrics, such as Distance, Time, etc... However, this story is to add the button and make it functional for the Visits metrics only.
